A simple facebook application to play videos in a single place

## Repo notes

we organize the repo to handle the appengine versions too.
There is a "stable" branch, that holds the instance id 1
and a "testing" version that holds the instance 2.

We merge the testing branch into stable and change the id before deploying.
